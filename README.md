# Game-of-Life
An object oriented approach to simulating the "Game of Life" as part of the interview process for the BBC. (Java)

All game rules have been implemented. The rules stated that the grid should be infinite, however, I have simply made the grid the maximum int value size, positive and negative. As I couldn't display a grid with 'infinite' dimensions, I have allowed the user to enter the living cells at the beginning in locations of their choosing. The user can set the max number of turns the game should play and will display all living cells at the end of each turn. At the end of the game, the number of generations is printed, along with the currently living cells. 

All the game's visuals are printed to the console.
